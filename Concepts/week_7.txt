PROGRAMMING TASKS DONE
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Completed implementing Bigram Hidden Markov Model
   POS Tagger using Viterbi's Algorithm.
2. Got an accuracy of 93% on the Bigram HMM Model.
3. Implemented a improved version of Trigram Hidden
   Markov Model using Viterbi's Algorithm by splitting
   the trigram into two and calculating probabilties by
   giving them certain weights.
4. Got an accuracy of 88.4% on the improved Trigram HMM
   Model.
5. Completed the programming of all the testing accuracy
   programs required throughout.
6. Got an accuracy of 89.5% on the English Decision Tree
   Model POS Tagger.
7. Got an accuracy of 87% on the Hindi Decision Tree Model
   POS Tagger.

RESULTS
------------------------------------------------------------

PART OF SPEECH TAGGERS

---------------------------------------------------
Hindi Bigram Hidden Markov Model = 93%
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Hindi Trigram Hidden Markov Model = 85%
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Hindi Improved Trigram Hidden Markov Model = 88.4%
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Hindi Decision Tree Classification Model = 87%
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
English Decision Tree Classification Model = 89.5%
---------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------

We have completed our task of implementing a Hindi
based POS Tagger and even extended it to make more
improved versions of it, also comparing it with the
decision tree model made for both Hindi and English.
Hence, we conclude our B.Tech Project.
