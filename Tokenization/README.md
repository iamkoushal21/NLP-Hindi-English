# TOKENIZATION - Natural Language Processing
------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------------------

The following commands must be executed to run the program:

      import nltk       -- In shell
      nltk.download()   -- Download 'all' in menu
      python3 tokenize_01.py

------------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM
------------------------------------------------

In the process of tokenization what we do is that we separate
or 'tokenize' a given text into sentences or words or maybe even
paragraphs. Each basic building block called 'token' is separated
by chopping the given text into the required pieces, perhaps at
the same time throwing away certain characters, such as
punctuation.
